Host：Good evening, folks! This is your host, John, and welcome to another insightful episode of our talk show where we delve into how to increase our productivity while working from home. Today, we have two distinguished guests. Please welcome Dr. Loren Mills and Mr. Charlie Dawson.
Host：Dr. Loren Mills, a renowned author and clinical psychologist with a specialty in productivity and mental wellness, welcome to the show! 
Dr. Loren Mills：Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure to be on the show.
Host：In your books, you have extensively tackled how to enhance productivity while working from home. Can you share some insights with our audience? 
Dr. Loren Mills：Certainly! Productivity at home is about more than being busy - it's about focusing energy on the right tasks and implementing smart strategies. Challenges like home distractions and lack of defined workspace can be overcome by creating a designated workspace and encouraging regular breaks. It's also important to maintain mental wellness and strike a work-life balance. Tools like task-management apps and time trackers can be helpful, as can techniques like time-blocking.
Host：That's very insightful, Dr. Mills. We need to channel our efforts smartly while maintaining our well-being. Let's quite welcome our next guest, productivity consultant, Mr. Charlie Dawson.
Charlie Dawson：Hello everyone! I'm excited to be here.
