Host：Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to tonight's episode where we dissect the art and science of effective conflict resolution in the workplace. I am your host, and joining us today are two stellar guests.
Host：First, we have Dr. Mark Spencer, an Occupational Psychologist with a background from Princeton and Harvard. He holds over a decade of experience as a consultant, specializing in workplace conflict resolution for major Fortune 500 companies. That's impressive! 
Host：Joining us also is Susan Fitzgerald, Human Resources Director with over 15 years of experience managing HR operations across diverse industries. Susan's academic background speaks for itself, having studied at Berkeley and MIT. Welcome both!
Host：Let's start this discussion with you, Mark. You mention your initial steps when a conflict arises involve understanding the situation, observing the root causes, and evaluating its severity. Could you tell us more about this mediation approach you employ?
Dr. Mark Spencer：Certainly! Mediation is all about open and respectful dialogue. I listen to all parties involved, gather information, and then, based on the severity and nature of the dispute, decide if an intervention is immediate or gradual.
Host：Interesting. Susan, as an HR-Director, how do you typically address conflicts when they arise in the workplace?
Susan Fitzgerald：Well, I have a systematic approach. I start by acknowledging the conflict and then ensuring all parties feel heard. After defining the problem, we explore solutions collaboratively. In my experience, direct engagement coupled with active listening usually leads to the best results.
