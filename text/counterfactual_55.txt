Host：Good evening, everyone! Welcome to a very special episode where we delve into an intriguing 'what if'. What if the Beatles had never formed as a band? To make this conjecture more interesting, we have two phenomenal individuals with us tonight who are very closely connected with the Beatles. Let's give a warm welcome to Paul McCartney, one of the most successful composers and performers of all time, famously known as a member of the Beatles. And, Mark Lewisohn, an English historian and author, renowned as one of the world's leading authorities on the Beatles.
Paul McCartney：Hello, it's wonderful to be here, thanks for having us.
Mark Lewisohn：Thank you for inviting me, looking forward to this discussion.
