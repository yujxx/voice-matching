Host：Hello and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to our enlightening talk show tonight, where we unravel the mysteries of fiscal and monetary policies amidst economic recessions. Let's get straight to it.
Host：With us today, we have two outstanding guests. Firstly, we welcome Dr. Hannah Miller, a distinguished Economics professor at Yale University with a wealth of knowledge and expertise. She once served as an advisor to the US Federal Reserve during the 2008 recession and has many impressive contributions to understanding monetary policy and economic recessions. A warm welcome to you Dr. Miller.
Dr. Hannah Miller：Thank you, it's a pleasure to be here.
Host：Here’s our next esteemed guest, Mr. James Stuart, the backbone of the UK government's economic strategies. He was pivotal in both the 2008 recession and developing the UK's financial response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Welcome to you, Mr. Stuart.
Mr. James Stuart：Delighted to join you and the audience.
