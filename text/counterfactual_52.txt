Host：Welcome to our program where we dive into thought-provoking alternatives of historical events. On today's session, we delve into a fascinating topic: 'What if the Aztecs had successfully repelled the Spanish Conquistadors?'
Host：Please join me in welcoming our esteemed guests, Dr. Maria Suarez, a prominent Professor of Mesoamerican History, and Dr. Philip Hudson, a noted Anthropologist specializing in alternate history.
Host：Starting with you, Dr. Suarez. You've studied the Aztec society extensively. Could you help us understand the civilization before the arrival of the Spanish?
Dr. Maria Suarez：Certainly. The Aztec society was complex and advanced in numerous fields. They had rich social stratification, cities showcasing architectural mastery, and displayed innovation in agriculture. They also had a sophisticated system for writing and education. Their resilience and adaptability make one believe their society could have thrived even further.
Host：And what was the impact of the Spanish Conquistadors' arrival on the Aztec Empire?
Dr. Maria Suarez：For the Aztecs, this marked a period of immense loss - culturally, socially, and geographically. It led to enslavement, disease, and degradation of their culture. A lot of these changes were perpetrated through political exploitation by the Spaniards.
Host：That's a tragic turn of events. Now, can you theorize the implications if Aztecs had successfully repelled the Conquistadors?
Dr. Maria Suarez：The immediate and most prominent shift would be the preservation of their culture, independence, and self-determination. They could have continued advancements in agriculture, engineering, and astronomy. Additionally, resisting the Spanish could have enforced their warrior spirit, increasing their chances of fending off future invasions.
Host：Sounds like a noteworthy alternative history. Dr. Hudson, can you share your insights?
Dr. Philip Hudson：Of course. My views resonate with Dr. Suarez. The pre-conquest Aztec society was advanced, particularly their capital, Tenochtitlan. The Europeans, bearing advanced weaponry and alien diseases, shattered this civilization. However, aspects of the Aztec culture survived, merging with European traditions to form modern Mexican culture.
