Host：Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to tonight's talk show where we dive deep into exciting technological adventures! I'm your host, and together we'll explore the intriguing world of quantum computing. We've invited two preeminent guests to guide us through this topic. 
Host：Please join me in welcoming our first guest of the night, Dr. Samantha Hartman, a renowned Quantum Physicist with pioneering contributions to Quantum Information science.
Dr. Samantha Hartman：Thank you for having me. Quantum computing uses the principles of quantum mechanics for information processing, with qubits as the smallest unit that can be both 1 and 0 simultaneously due to 'superposition'.
Host：Fascinating, isn't it? Can you delve a bit deeper into the principles that set quantum computing apart from classical computing, Dr. Hartman?
Dr. Samantha Hartman：Certainly, the key principles are superposition and entanglement. Superposition allows a qubit to be both 0 and 1 at the same time, and entanglement causes particles to become interlinked, and the state of one affect the other, no matter how far apart.
Host：Quantum computing is clearly an exciting field with great potential. How has your work in quantum physics impacted the world of astrophysics, Dr. Hartman?
Dr. Samantha Hartman：Quantum algorithms could revolutionize astrophysics by simulating complex cosmic phenomena. Not just limited to astrophysics, other sectors like cryptography, healthcare, material science, and finance could also benefit from this, as it enables previously unsolvable problems to be solved.
Host：On that note, let's bring in our next guest. Please welcome Mr. Fredrick Jones, a distinguished tech entrepreneur with a focus on quantum computing applications in the business sector.
Mr. Fredrick Jones：Thank you, it's a pleasure to be here. To simplify, you can think of classical computing as using switches - they are either on or off, 1 or 0. However, quantum computing uses qubits which can be both on and off at the same time due to superposition.
