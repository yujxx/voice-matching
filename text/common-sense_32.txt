Host：Good evening everyone, welcome to our enriching and insightful talk show tonight! Let's dive into our topic: 'The Art of Pretending to Understand'. We are privileged to have two very distinguished guests tonight!
Host：Please welcome Dr. Louise Montgomery, a respected psychologist with a PhD from Harvard. She has over 20 years of studying human behaviors and has published several research papers on non-verbal cues and micro-expressions. We are excited to hear your expert insights, Dr. Montgomery.
Host：And with us is Mr. Adam Spencer, a master in Communication Studies from Stanford, and a dedicated communication skills trainer. With his expertise on identifying signs of confusion and hesitance in communication, we look forward to your contributions, Mr. Spencer.
Host：Let's start with you, Dr. Montgomery. Could you help us understand the signs that indicate someone is pretending to get a concept?
Dr. Louise Montgomery：Certainly. Some physical cues are over-nodding, a blank facial expression with a hesitant smile and possibly avoiding eye contact. They might also have a sharp intake of breath which can indicate surprise or confusion. You might also notice more filler words in their speech. There can be a delay in their response and non-specific affirmations like 'I see' or 'Interesting'. They might change the subject or adopt an agreeable posture quickly.
Dr. Louise Montgomery：There are layers to this issue. When someone is pretending to understand, phrases like 'Could you expand on that?' or 'So, you're saying...' are used often. This can lead to misunderstandings and misinformation, which in professional settings could result in faulty decision-making.
Dr. Louise Montgomery：The best approach is empathy. Explain things in a simpler way, use analogies, or ask their opinion. Encourage a culture where asking questions is appreciated and not stigmatized.
Dr. Louise Montgomery：Through my experiences and studies, I've noticed certain variations across different demographic groups. Older adults might try to change the topic more, men might appear more assertive, and cultural factors can cause variations in the subtle and indirect cues.
Host：Indeed, very insightful, Dr. Montgomery. Now, Mr. Spencer, is there anything you’d like to add?
Mr. Adam Spencer：Yes, several cues such as nods of agreement coming at the wrong time, frequent blinking, squinting, or a slightly furrowed brow can indicate confusion. An affected listener might have a glazed-over look in their eyes or a monotonous voice. They may also use vague or non-specific language, rephrase your statements as questions, or use filler responses.
