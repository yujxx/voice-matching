Host：Good evening, everyone, and welcome to another enthralling episode of our show 'What If?' where we engage with stimulating hypothetical scenarios. Today, we're posed with an intriguing question: What if Sir Isaac Newton had turned his genius towards biology instead of physics? We've invited two esteemed guests who are experts in their respective fields. Let's welcome Dr. Charles Simonton and Professor Lydia Howell!
Dr. Charles Simonton：Good evening, and thank you for inviting me here. I'm looking forward to discussing this fascinating topic. If Newton's focus had been on biology, he could have significantly accelerated our understanding of life and its processes.
Professor Lydia Howell：Hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to join you today. Newton's profound intellectual curiosity could have pushed biological studies forwards, opening up vast new fields of inquiry.
