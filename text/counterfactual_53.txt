Host：Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to our enlightening talk show tonight. We are about to delve deep into an important historical question: 'What if the Black Death had not occurred in the 14th century?' Joining us today are two remarkable scholars who are experts on this topic.
Host：Our first guest is Dr. Elaine Snyder, a highly respected historian with a PhD in Medieval History from Yale University. She has conducted extensive research on the Black Death's societal impact and has been recognized with numerous awards. Welcome Dr. Snyder!
Host：Our second guest is Prof. Howard Clarke, an economist with an affinity for economic trends during the Middle Ages. He earned his PhD in Economic History from Harvard University. He is well-known for his book 'The Black Death and Economic Transformation: A New Narrative'. We are delighted to have you here, Prof. Clarke!
Host：Let’s start with a brief overview of Europe before the Black Death. Dr. Snyder, can you help set the scene for us?
Dr. Elaine Snyder：Certainly. Before the outbreak, Europe saw a steady population growth. Agriculture was the backbone of the economy, and society was structured hierarchically with the manorial system. Trade was growing, but slowly, and an inequality between the rich and the poor was quite palpable.
Host：Now, Prof. Clarke, can you share the economic perspective of that time?
Prof. Howard Clarke：Absolutely. The rapid population growth led to greater demand for resources. There wasn’t much technological progression, making the economy rely heavily on labor-intensive agriculture.
