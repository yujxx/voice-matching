Host：Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our visionary talk show! Tonight, we dive into a thought-provoking question - 'What if Vincent van Gogh had been a successful artist during his lifetime?'
Host：Joining us to shed light on this intriguing topic, we have Dr. Elaine Pretorius, a renowned Art Historian, author of 'Artistry in Crisis: Van Gogh's Unyielding Pursuit of Success', and Gregory Howard, an accomplished contemporary artist, renowned for his post-impressionistic style.
Host：Dr. Elaine, with over 25 years of focus on Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art, you believe the narrative of van Gogh's work could've been different had he achieved commercial success in his lifetime. Could you explain this further?
Dr. Elaine Pretorius：Indeed. Van Gogh's story of struggle, unrequited excellence, and posthumous recognition contributes to the 'tortured artist' archetype. Commercial success could have influenced his artistic focus, style and the overall narrative. He might have garnered patrons who may have dictated his work according to their tastes.
Host：You also mentioned that despite his personal turbulence, he still managed to create works of incredible magnitude. You seem to separate his genius from his suffering?
Dr. Elaine Pretorius：Absolutely. Van Gogh's suffering was significant, but he wasn’t a genius because he suffered, he was a genius who happened to suffer. His tormented life certainly influenced his work, but his talent was independent of that.
Host：Now, let's aim this lens at contemporary art with Gregory. How could Van Gogh’s success during his lifetime have impacted modern art?
Gregory Howard：His style was revolutionary for his time. A successful Van Gogh might have sparked more imitation, leading to an acceleration of movements like Fauvism and Expressionism. Successful, his techniques and style would have played a more pivotal role in shaping modern art.
