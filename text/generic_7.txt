Host：Hello everyone, welcome to our in-depth talkshow 'Think with Us'! I'm your host, Alex, and today we'll be touching the cornerstone of decision-making, the art of Critical Thinking. We have two honored guests joining us tonight—Dr. Jane Martin, a renowned cognitive psychologist, and Prof. Tom Adams, a distinguished philosophy professor.
Host：Welcome to the show Dr. Martin and Prof. Adams! It's great to have you both with us. Dr. Martin, I'll begin with you. Could you briefly explain to our audience what exactly critical thinking is?
Dr. Jane Martin：Sure, Alex. Critical thinking is the ability to logically connect ideas, analyze our own thoughts and assess the validity of arguments around us. In an era of the information overload, it helps us make informed, accurate and ethical decisions.
Host：Insightful explanation, Dr. Martin! Now, Prof. Adams, would you suggest that critical thinking can be taught and developed?
Prof. Tom Adams：Absolutely, Alex. Encouraging curiosity, teaching argument validation, understanding biases, encouraging self-reflection and broadening the horizons of our knowledge can all contribute to the development of critical thinking. All it requires is patience and determination.
