Host：Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight's episode of 'What If...?'. Today, we explore the intriguing topic: 'What if Christopher Columbus had not discovered the Americas?'. And who better to guide us through this journey than our distinguished guests, Dr. Alice Carter, an esteemed historian specializing in the era of discoveries, and Prof. Benjamin Collins, an anthropologist with extensive fieldwork among the indigenous cultures of the Americas. Welcome to the show!
Host：Dr. Carter, before we delve into the hypothetical, could you paint us a picture of the world before Columbus's arrival in the Americas?
Dr. Alice Carter：Absolutely, the Americas before Columbus were diverse continents, home to sophisticated civilizations such as the Incas, Mayans, and Aztecs. These cultures had developed advanced systems of mathematics, astronomy, agriculture and urban planning, demonstrating enviable cultural diversity.
Host：That's absolutely fascinating. Prof. Collins, from an anthropological perspective, how do you envision this complex societal picture?
Prof. Benjamin Collins：Indeed, as Dr. Carter mentioned, the Americas housed complex civilizations. There were distinct languages, political systems, religious beliefs, and diverse ecosystems. The cultural traditions, languages, and histories were truly rich.
