Host：Hello, everyone, and welcome to our talk show! Today, we're delving into the world of local businesses and why many consumers prefer them over big chain stores despite the difference in price. Joining us to share insights on this are John Davidson, a successful local business owner, and Diana Mitchell, an expert economist and consumer behavior researcher. Welcome to both of you!
John Davidson：Thank you for having me. It's always exciting to discuss this topic and share experiences from my own business, Davidson’s Groceries.
Diana Mitchell：Thank you! I’m eager to bring findings from my research to the table and discuss this topic from an academic angle.
