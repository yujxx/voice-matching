Host：Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for tuning in. We're going to dive deep and discuss 'What if Alan Turing had not cracked the Enigma code during World War II?' It's a topic that has had both historians and computer scientists pondering over its implications.
Host：Today, we're lucky to have Dr. Michael Swift, History Professor and author of 'If Not Turing: Alternate World War II Outcomes', and Sandra Rimmer, a computer scientist who has worked as a cryptographer for the NSA. Welcome both.
Dr. Michael Swift：Thank you for inviting me. Turing's work during World War II was indeed groundbreaking. The Enigma machine was used by Nazi Germany for encryption, but Turing’s decoding of the code provided critical insights into the enemy’s tactics. We owe him for potentially shortening the war significantly.
Sandra Rimmer：Absolutely agreed, Dr. Swift. Turing was instrumental in breaking the Enigma code and saved countless lives. His work at Bletchley Park undermined Nazi Germany’s military commands.
